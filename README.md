# Endava Coding Challenge

## Frontend Challenge (HTML/CSS/JS) "GitHub Resumé"

Thank you for accepting the challenge!
Please implement a Single Page-Application that let users build a GitHub resumé
similiar to https://resume.github.io/.

## Requirements

- Create a landing page where the user can enter his or her GitHub account name.
- Implement the provided design
- Implement a “generate button” on the landing page that starts processing the
  previously entered account name and shows a result view to the user (the generated
  resumé).
- The result view consists of the following:
- Very basic GitHub profile information
- A summary of which programming languages the GitHub account owner has used in
  his/her repositories (with percentage).
- A list of the most popular repositories of the GitHub account owner with title, repository
  description and the amount of stars and forks.
- Implement a kind of model that connects the data to the given HTML / JavaScript
  template. You may use a view framework like React or Vue but this is not mandatory.
- Make sure to use the official GitHub API, please don't start parsing web pages
  manually.
- Stick to the given design as best as you can. Please do not use any CSS framework like
  Bootstrap or Foundation.
- The mark-up should fulfill basic accessibility standards. For example, form fields should
  be associated with a label, alt tags should be used. For keyboard operability there are
  bonus points.
- Please make sure that the markup is W3C valid and semantically correct. You can
  ignore errors caused by accessible attributes.
- The layout should work in newest versions of Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge - and of
  course Internet Explorer 11 :)

Please create a private repository on github.com named like “challenge-{firstname-lastname}” for the task and invite endava-frontend-challenge (at Settings->Collaborators), so that our developers can have a look at it.

If you have any questions please feel free to contact us!
Good luck and many thanks in advance!
